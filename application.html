<h2>About the job</h2>
	<p> 1Day Market is a start from scratch busniness meaning this was all started from an idea from home and executed to a point where it could be an at home business.This means most products will be kept at home if hired. This allows you to work at your own pace TO AN EXTENT, you still need to deliver orders, package them, etc, on time for the customer. </p>

<h3> Pay </h3>
	<p>Pay varies based upon the number of product sold, harder workers tend to recieve higher pay! employees will usually get 20% of a sale with room for raises and even a chance to keep a pair or two if progress is present.
