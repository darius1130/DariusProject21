<h2>1Day Market</h2>
	<p>1Day Market is a apparel based brand focusing on making dreams come true with creativity. The name was brought up by the idea of taking every situation day by day rather than all at one time. </p>

<h3>Apparel</h3>
	<p>1Day Market focuses on main and underground street wear and most of all the shoes. We chose shoes as the main focus because of the constant love and attention they recieve.  </p>

<h3>Reviews</h3>
	<p>“Unique designs and amazing creativity!”
One Day Market has quickly become one of my favorite places to shop. Their apparel has a creative spark you don’t find anywhere else, and every piece feels like it has a story behind it. The quality is fantastic, and the staff is always so friendly and passionate about their craft. Can’t wait to see what they release next!</p>

<p>“A brand with real meaning.”
What I love most about One Day Market is the message behind the brand—taking things one day at a time. Their clothing reflects that positive, uplifting energy. I bought a hoodie and a tee and both feel premium and look great. The gallery space is also beautiful and gives a real local-artist vibe. Highly recommend stopping by.</p>

<p>“Stylish, thoughtful, and well-made.”
I stumbled upon One Day Market during an event, and I’m so glad I did. Their designs are stylish without trying too hard, and the craftsmanship is impressive. You can tell the team puts heart into every product. I’ve already gotten compliments on the shirt I bought. Will definitely be returning for more!</p>
